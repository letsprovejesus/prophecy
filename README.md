# Introduction

There are over 3,000 prophecies in the Bible that have come true. However, many atheists claim that these prophecies do not exist or are too vague. Some may be vague, but there are enough that are not. I will present these prophecies here, along with their probability.

I used ChatGPT in this source. And the WEB Bible

# The birth of Jesus in Bethlehem

It was prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. The following passage from the Old Testament prophesies this: 

Micah 5:2 says the following: (WEB)
```
“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
    though you are small among the clans[b] of Judah,
out of you will come for me
    one who will be ruler over Israel,
whose origins are from of old,
    from ancient times.”
```

At this point, it is prophesied that the future Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. 

This is confirmed in the New Testament in the following passages:
Matthew 2, 1,6
```
2 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men[a] from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, 2 “Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” 3 When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. 5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,

6 ‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,
    are in no way least among the princes of Judah;
for out of you shall come a governor
    who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”
```

This is also confirmed in Luke 2:1-7:

```
2 Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. 2 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city. 4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 5 to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.

6 While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth. 7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
```

# How likely was it that he would be born in Bethlehem of all places? 

At that time, Bethlehem was a small, insignificant village—not Jerusalem, not Hebron, not Samaria.
This makes the prophecy concrete and verifiable.


How small was Bethlehem at the time of Jesus?

Archaeological estimates:

Population of Bethlehem at the time of Jesus: approx. 300–1,000 people

Total population of Judea (including Galilee and Samaria): approx. 500,000–1,000,000 people

If you were born in Judea by chance, the probability that it would be in Bethlehem would be approximately:

### Given Assumptions
| Variable | Meaning | Estimated Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| N_total | Total population of Judea (including Galilee & Samaria, around 1st century) | 1,000,000 people |
| N_Bethlehem | Population of Bethlehem at the time of Jesus | 1,000 people |

---

### Calculation
P(Bethlehem) = N_Bethlehem / N_total  
P(Bethlehem) = 1,000 / 1,000,000  
P(Bethlehem) = 0.001 = 0.1%

---

### Result
So, roughly **1 out of every 1,000** people from Judea would have been born in Bethlehem by chance.

---

### Notes
- If Bethlehem’s population was smaller (say, 300):
  - P = 300 / 1,000,000 = 0.0003 = 0.03%
- Therefore:
  - P(Bethlehem) ≈ 0.03%–0.1%  
  → **≈ 1 in 1,000–3,000 chance**

Let's assume the worst case scenario and say that 1,000 people lived there, so we'll take 0.1%.

# The Virgin Birth

The Old Testament describes that the Messiah will be born of a virgin. Isaiah 7:14 states the following:

```
14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.[a]
```
a: 7:14 “Immanuel” means “God with us”.

This is confirmed in Luke 26:33.
```
26 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary. 28 Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!”

29 But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. 30 The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Jesus.’ 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”
```

Matthew 1:18-25 also confirms this, so again we have two different independent sources.

```
18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 19 Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. 20 But when he thought about these things, behold,[d] an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 21 She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus,[e] for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”

22 Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

23 “Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
    and shall give birth to a son.
They shall call his name Immanuel,”
    which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”

24 Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; 25 and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
```

# How likely is that?

Since miracles cannot happen without divine intervention from a scientific point of view, let's assume a 50% probability here. I think we all know that this is a very generous estimate.

P(Virgin) = 0.5 = 50%

# Betrayed for 30 pieces of silver

It was prophesied that Jesus would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.

```
11 It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that listened to me knew that it was Yahweh’s word. 12 I said to them, “If you think it best, give me my wages; and if not, keep them.” So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver.
```

Context in the Book of Zechariah

Zechariah speaks symbolically as a shepherd who tends the people of Israel.
But the people reject him—symbolically, just as Israel later rejects the Messiah.
The 30 pieces of silver are the “wages” they pay him for his loyalty—a mocking price.

In Exodus 21:32, this is the price for a slave—the lowest possible wage.

This shows that:

The good shepherd (a picture of the Messiah) is valued and despised like a slave.

In the New Testament, the previously prophesied event is described in the following passages:

Matthew 26,14-16
```
14 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15 and said, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?” So they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. 16 From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
```

Matthew 27,3-10

```
3 Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 4 saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.”

But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”

5 He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself.

6 The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” 7 They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them to bury strangers in. 8 Therefore that field has been called “The Field of Blood” to this day. 9 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah[a] the prophet was fulfilled, saying,

“They took the thirty pieces of silver,
    the price of him upon whom a price had been set,
    whom some of the children of Israel priced,
10 and they gave them for the potter’s field,
    as the Lord commanded me.”
```

Matthew explicitly comments:

``Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah[a] the prophet was fulfilled, saying...``
(Matthew 27:9–10)

It is interesting to note that Matthew writes

“... what was said through the prophet Jeremiah ...”
even though the words are found in Zechariah 11:12–13.

This is usually explained as follows:

Matthew summarizes Jeremiah 19 (the potter's field) and Zechariah 11 (the 30 pieces of silver).

In Jewish tradition, “Jeremiah” often stood for the entire prophetic role (Jeremiah was the first prophet in the scriptural order at that time).

Jeremiah 19 is actually the key to understanding why Matthew 27:9–10 attributes the words about the 30 pieces of silver to “Jeremiah,” even though they actually come from Zechariah 11:12–13.
Let's look at this step by step.

Jeremiah 19, 1-2:
```
19 Thus said Yahweh, “Go, and buy a potter’s earthen container, and take some of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests; 2 and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I will tell you. 
```

God commands Jeremiah to buy a vessel from the potter and then break it in front of the leaders of Israel—as a sign of the coming judgment on Jerusalem.

Jeremiah 19:10–11 – The sign of judgment

```
10 “Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with you, 11 and shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “Even so I will break this people and this city as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.
```

The potter's jar symbolizes Jerusalem, which is judged and broken because of its sin.

Connection to Matthew 27

Matthew 27:3–10 reports:

Judas repented of his betrayal,
threw the 30 pieces of silver into the temple,
and the priests bought a potter's field with them
– “as a burial place for strangers.”

Then Matthew comments:

"Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled ...
and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the valued one,
and gave them for the potter's field ..."
— Matthew 27:9–10

Matthew combines two Old Testament images:

Zechariah 11:12–13: 30 pieces of silver thrown into the house of the Lord,
 Theme: betrayal, payment, devaluation

Jeremiah 19: Potter and the valley of judgment
Theme: Punishment, judgment on Israel

Just to explain, so you understand the context. Now let's calculate how likely that is.

# How likely is it that

This is one of the most interesting prophecies because it seems so specific:

a specific sum (30 pieces of silver)

a specific action (money thrown away in the temple)

a specific group of people (religious leaders)

a specific object (the potter's field)

So it is not just a “vague symbol,” but several precise details that connect Matthew 27 with Zechariah 11:12–13.

Step 1: What exactly does the prophecy say?
"They weighed out thirty pieces of silver as my reward.
The LORD said, 'Throw it to the smelter [or: potter], the glorious money ...
and I threw it into the house of the LORD, to the potter."
— Zechariah 11:12–13

This means:

the shepherd (symbolizing the Messiah) is “valued” at 30 pieces of silver,

the money ends up in the temple,

and it goes to a potter.

Step 2: Fulfillment in the New Testament

Matthew 27:3–10:

Judas betrays Jesus for 30 pieces of silver,

he throws the money into the temple,

the priests use it to buy the “potter's field.”

These are three very specific correspondences with Zechariah 11.

### ⚙️ Step 3: Probability Estimate

| Feature | Prophecy (Zechariah 11) | Fulfillment (Matthew 27) | Estimated Random Probability |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ Specific price | "They weighed out thirty pieces of silver as my wages." | Judas is paid exactly thirty pieces of silver. | ~1 : 1,000 (a specific sum among many possible) |
| 2️⃣ Temple connection | "Throw it to the house of the LORD." | Judas throws the money into the temple. | ~1 : 100 (matching location) |
| 3️⃣ Potter reference | "...to the potter." | The priests buy the potter’s field. | ~1 : 50 (rare symbolic link) |

**Combined probability (if independent):**

P(random) = 1/1000 × 1/100 × 1/50 = 1/5,000,000

➡️ Roughly **1 in 5 million** chance that all three details would align purely by coincidence.

Incidentally, this story is also described in Mark 14:10–11 and Luke 22:3–6, albeit not in such detail.

```
10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. 11 They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
```

```
3 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. 4 And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. 5 They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 6 He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
