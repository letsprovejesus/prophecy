# Introduction

There are over 3,000 prophecies in the Bible that have come true. However, many atheists claim that these prophecies do not exist or are too vague. Some may be vague, but there are enough that are not. I will present these prophecies here, along with their probability.

I used ChatGPT in this source. And the WEB Bible

# The birth of Jesus in Bethlehem

It was prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. The following passage from the Old Testament prophesies this: 

Micah 5:2 says the following: (WEB)
```
“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
    though you are small among the clans[b] of Judah,
out of you will come for me
    one who will be ruler over Israel,
whose origins are from of old,
    from ancient times.”
```

At this point, it is prophesied that the future Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. 

This is confirmed in the New Testament in the following passages:
Matthew 2, 1,6
```
2 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men[a] from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, 2 “Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” 3 When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. 5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,

6 ‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,
    are in no way least among the princes of Judah;
for out of you shall come a governor
    who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”
```

This is also confirmed in Luke 2:1-7:

```
2 Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. 2 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city. 4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 5 to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.

6 While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth. 7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
```

# How likely was it that he would be born in Bethlehem of all places? 

At that time, Bethlehem was a small, insignificant village—not Jerusalem, not Hebron, not Samaria.
This makes the prophecy concrete and verifiable.


How small was Bethlehem at the time of Jesus?

Archaeological estimates:

Population of Bethlehem at the time of Jesus: approx. 300–1,000 people

Total population of Judea (including Galilee and Samaria): approx. 500,000–1,000,000 people

If you were born in Judea by chance, the probability that it would be in Bethlehem would be approximately:

### Given Assumptions
| Variable | Meaning | Estimated Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| N_total | Total population of Judea (including Galilee & Samaria, around 1st century) | 1,000,000 people |
| N_Bethlehem | Population of Bethlehem at the time of Jesus | 1,000 people |

---

### Calculation
P(Bethlehem) = N_Bethlehem / N_total  
P(Bethlehem) = 1,000 / 1,000,000  
P(Bethlehem) = 0.001 = 0.1%

---

### Result
So, roughly **1 out of every 1,000** people from Judea would have been born in Bethlehem by chance.

---

### Notes
- If Bethlehem’s population was smaller (say, 300):
  - P = 300 / 1,000,000 = 0.0003 = 0.03%
- Therefore:
  - P(Bethlehem) ≈ 0.03%–0.1%  
  → **≈ 1 in 1,000–3,000 chance**

Let's assume the worst case scenario and say that 1,000 people lived there, so we'll take 0.1%.

# The Virgin Birth

The Old Testament describes that the Messiah will be born of a virgin. Isaiah 7:14 states the following:

```
14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.[a]
```
a: 7:14 “Immanuel” means “God with us”.

This is confirmed in Luke 26:33.
```
26 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary. 28 Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!”

29 But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. 30 The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Jesus.’ 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”
```

Matthew 1:18-25 also confirms this, so again we have two different independent sources.

```
18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 19 Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. 20 But when he thought about these things, behold,[d] an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 21 She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus,[e] for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”

22 Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

23 “Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
    and shall give birth to a son.
They shall call his name Immanuel,”
    which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”

24 Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; 25 and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
