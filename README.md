# Introduction

There are over 3,000 prophecies in the Bible that have come true. However, many atheists claim that these prophecies do not exist or are too vague. Some may be vague, but there are enough that are not. I will present these prophecies here, along with their probability.

# The birth of Jesus in Bethlehem

It was prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. The following passage from the Old Testament prophesies this: 

Micah 5:2 says the following: (WEB)
```
“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
    though you are small among the clans[b] of Judah,
out of you will come for me
    one who will be ruler over Israel,
whose origins are from of old,
    from ancient times.”
```

At this point, it is prophesied that the future Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. 

This is confirmed in the New Testament in the following passages:
Matthew 2, 1,6
```
2 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men[a] from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, 2 “Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” 3 When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. 5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,

6 ‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,
    are in no way least among the princes of Judah;
for out of you shall come a governor
    who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”
