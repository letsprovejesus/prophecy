# Introduction

There are over 3,000 prophecies in the Bible that have come true. However, many atheists claim that these prophecies do not exist or are too vague. Some may be vague, but there are enough that are not. I will present these prophecies here, along with their probability.

I used ChatGPT in this source. And the WEB Bible

# The birth of Jesus in Bethlehem

It was prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. The following passage from the Old Testament prophesies this: 

Micah 5:2 says the following: (WEB)
```
“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
    though you are small among the clans[b] of Judah,
out of you will come for me
    one who will be ruler over Israel,
whose origins are from of old,
    from ancient times.”
```

At this point, it is prophesied that the future Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. 

This is confirmed in the New Testament in the following passages:
Matthew 2, 1,6
```
2 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men[a] from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, 2 “Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” 3 When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. 5 They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,

6 ‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah,
    are in no way least among the princes of Judah;
for out of you shall come a governor
    who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”
```

This is also confirmed in Luke 2:1-7:

```
2 Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. 2 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city. 4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 5 to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.

6 While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth. 7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
```

# How likely was it that he would be born in Bethlehem of all places? 

At that time, Bethlehem was a small, insignificant village—not Jerusalem, not Hebron, not Samaria.
This makes the prophecy concrete and verifiable.


How small was Bethlehem at the time of Jesus?

Archaeological estimates:

Population of Bethlehem at the time of Jesus: approx. 300–1,000 people

Total population of Judea (including Galilee and Samaria): approx. 500,000–1,000,000 people

If you were born in Judea by chance, the probability that it would be in Bethlehem would be approximately:

### Given Assumptions
| Variable | Meaning | Estimated Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| N_total | Total population of Judea (including Galilee & Samaria, around 1st century) | 1,000,000 people |
| N_Bethlehem | Population of Bethlehem at the time of Jesus | 1,000 people |

---

### Calculation
P(Bethlehem) = N_Bethlehem / N_total  
P(Bethlehem) = 1,000 / 1,000,000  
P(Bethlehem) = 0.001 = 0.1%

---

### Result
So, roughly **1 out of every 1,000** people from Judea would have been born in Bethlehem by chance.

---

### Notes
- If Bethlehem’s population was smaller (say, 300):
  - P = 300 / 1,000,000 = 0.0003 = 0.03%
- Therefore:
  - P(Bethlehem) ≈ 0.03%–0.1%  
  → **≈ 1 in 1,000–3,000 chance**

Let's assume the worst case scenario and say that 1,000 people lived there, so we'll take 0.1%.

# The Virgin Birth

The Old Testament describes that the Messiah will be born of a virgin. Isaiah 7:14 states the following:

```
14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.[a]
```
a: 7:14 “Immanuel” means “God with us”.

This is confirmed in Luke 26:33.
```
26 Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary. 28 Having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!”

29 But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. 30 The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31 Behold, you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Jesus.’ 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”
```

Matthew 1:18-25 also confirms this, so again we have two different independent sources.

```
18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. 19 Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. 20 But when he thought about these things, behold,[d] an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 21 She shall give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus,[e] for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”

22 Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

23 “Behold, the virgin shall be with child,
    and shall give birth to a son.
They shall call his name Immanuel,”
    which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”

24 Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself; 25 and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
```

# How likely is that?

Since miracles cannot happen without divine intervention from a scientific point of view, let's assume a 50% probability here. I think we all know that this is a very generous estimate.

P(Virgin) = 0.5 = 50%

# Betrayed for 30 pieces of silver

It was prophesied that Jesus would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.

```
11 It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that listened to me knew that it was Yahweh’s word. 12 I said to them, “If you think it best, give me my wages; and if not, keep them.” So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver.
```

Context in the Book of Zechariah

Zechariah speaks symbolically as a shepherd who tends the people of Israel.
But the people reject him—symbolically, just as Israel later rejects the Messiah.
The 30 pieces of silver are the “wages” they pay him for his loyalty—a mocking price.

In Exodus 21:32, this is the price for a slave—the lowest possible wage.

This shows that:

The good shepherd (a picture of the Messiah) is valued and despised like a slave.

In the New Testament, the previously prophesied event is described in the following passages:

Matthew 26,14-16
```
14 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests 15 and said, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?” So they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver. 16 From that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
```

Matthew 27,3-10

```
3 Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 4 saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.”

But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”

5 He threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself.

6 The chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.” 7 They took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them to bury strangers in. 8 Therefore that field has been called “The Field of Blood” to this day. 9 Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah[a] the prophet was fulfilled, saying,

“They took the thirty pieces of silver,
    the price of him upon whom a price had been set,
    whom some of the children of Israel priced,
10 and they gave them for the potter’s field,
    as the Lord commanded me.”
```

Matthew explicitly comments:

``Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah[a] the prophet was fulfilled, saying...``
(Matthew 27:9–10)

It is interesting to note that Matthew writes

“... what was said through the prophet Jeremiah ...”
even though the words are found in Zechariah 11:12–13.

This is usually explained as follows:

Matthew summarizes Jeremiah 19 (the potter's field) and Zechariah 11 (the 30 pieces of silver).

In Jewish tradition, “Jeremiah” often stood for the entire prophetic role (Jeremiah was the first prophet in the scriptural order at that time).

Jeremiah 19 is actually the key to understanding why Matthew 27:9–10 attributes the words about the 30 pieces of silver to “Jeremiah,” even though they actually come from Zechariah 11:12–13.
Let's look at this step by step.

Jeremiah 19, 1-2:
```
19 Thus said Yahweh, “Go, and buy a potter’s earthen container, and take some of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests; 2 and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I will tell you. 
```

God commands Jeremiah to buy a vessel from the potter and then break it in front of the leaders of Israel—as a sign of the coming judgment on Jerusalem.

Jeremiah 19:10–11 – The sign of judgment

```
10 “Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with you, 11 and shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “Even so I will break this people and this city as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.
```

The potter's jar symbolizes Jerusalem, which is judged and broken because of its sin.

Connection to Matthew 27

Matthew 27:3–10 reports:

Judas repented of his betrayal,
threw the 30 pieces of silver into the temple,
and the priests bought a potter's field with them
– “as a burial place for strangers.”

Then Matthew comments:

"Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled ...
and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the valued one,
and gave them for the potter's field ..."
— Matthew 27:9–10

Matthew combines two Old Testament images:

Zechariah 11:12–13: 30 pieces of silver thrown into the house of the Lord,
 Theme: betrayal, payment, devaluation

Jeremiah 19: Potter and the valley of judgment
Theme: Punishment, judgment on Israel

Just to explain, so you understand the context. Now let's calculate how likely that is.

# How likely is it that

This is one of the most interesting prophecies because it seems so specific:

a specific sum (30 pieces of silver)

a specific action (money thrown away in the temple)

a specific group of people (religious leaders)

a specific object (the potter's field)

So it is not just a “vague symbol,” but several precise details that connect Matthew 27 with Zechariah 11:12–13.

Step 1: What exactly does the prophecy say?
"They weighed out thirty pieces of silver as my reward.
The LORD said, 'Throw it to the smelter [or: potter], the glorious money ...
and I threw it into the house of the LORD, to the potter."
— Zechariah 11:12–13

This means:

the shepherd (symbolizing the Messiah) is “valued” at 30 pieces of silver,

the money ends up in the temple,

and it goes to a potter.

Step 2: Fulfillment in the New Testament

Matthew 27:3–10:

Judas betrays Jesus for 30 pieces of silver,

he throws the money into the temple,

the priests use it to buy the “potter's field.”

These are three very specific correspondences with Zechariah 11.

### ⚙️ Step 3: Probability Estimate

| Feature | Prophecy (Zechariah 11) | Fulfillment (Matthew 27) | Estimated Random Probability |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ Specific price | "They weighed out thirty pieces of silver as my wages." | Judas is paid exactly thirty pieces of silver. | ~1 : 1,000 (a specific sum among many possible) |
| 2️⃣ Temple connection | "Throw it to the house of the LORD." | Judas throws the money into the temple. | ~1 : 100 (matching location) |
| 3️⃣ Potter reference | "...to the potter." | The priests buy the potter’s field. | ~1 : 50 (rare symbolic link) |

**Combined probability (if independent):**

P(random) = 1/1000 × 1/100 × 1/50 = 1/5,000,000

➡️ Roughly **1 in 5 million** chance that all three details would align purely by coincidence.

Incidentally, this story is also described in Mark 14:10–11 and Luke 22:3–6, albeit not in such detail.

```
10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. 11 They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
```

```
3 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. 4 And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. 5 They were delighted and agreed to give him money. 6 He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
```

# The Suffering of the Messiah

Isaiah 50:5–6 describes how the Messiah will suffer before the crucifixion. It says the following. 

```
5 The Sovereign Lord has opened my ears;
    I have not been rebellious,
    I have not turned away.
6 I offered my back to those who beat me,
    my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard;
I did not hide my face
    from mocking and spitting.
```

The meaning here is as follows: The servant of God suffers voluntarily, without resistance, and endures beatings and mockery. This is fulfilled in the New Testament in the following passage: Matthew 26:67, Matthew 27:30.

```
67 Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him
```

```
30 They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
```

# How likely is this?

In the case of “Jesus is beaten, spat on, and mocked” (Isaiah 50:6 → Matthew 26–27), we are talking about something that is easy to imagine in terms of content, but nevertheless remarkable in its frequency and precision.
Let's take a realistic and differentiated look at this.

Statements in the text:

beaten

spit on / mocked

beard torn out / humiliation

voluntarily endured

In the fulfillment in the New Testament: Three of the four details are literally fulfilled here: beatings, mockery, spitting.

### 📊 Step 3: Probability Estimate — "He will be struck, spat upon, and mocked" (Isaiah 50:6 → Matthew 26–27)

| Detail | Prophecy (Isaiah 50:6) | Fulfillment (Matthew 26–27) | Estimated Random Probability |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ Struck / beaten | “I offered my back to those who struck me.” | Jesus is beaten by guards (Matthew 26:67). | ~1 : 5 (physical violence common in executions) |
| 2️⃣ Spat upon | “I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting.” | Jesus is spat on (Matthew 26:67; 27:30). | ~1 : 20 (not always part of executions) |
| 3️⃣ Mocked / humiliated | “I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.” | Soldiers and crowds mock him (Matthew 27:29, 39–44). | ~1 : 10 (public ridicule likely but not certain) |

**Combined random probability (assuming independence):**

P(random) = 1/5 × 1/20 × 1/10 = 1/1,000

➡️ Roughly **1 in 1,000** chance that all three details would coincide purely by coincidence.

---

# The steadfastness of Jesus

Isaiah 50:6 says the following:

```
7 Because the Sovereign Lord helps me,
    I will not be disgraced.
Therefore have I set my face like flint,
    and I know I will not be put to shame.
```

Meaning: The servant remains steadfast in suffering and trusts in God.

This is fulfilled in the New Testament in:
Mark 15, 3-5
```
3 The chief priests accused him of many things. 4 Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”

5 But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.
```

# How likely is this?

Meaning:

“Face like a pebble” → an image of determination and steadfastness.

The servant of God does not retreat, even when faced with suffering, ridicule, or death.

He trusts in God and remains unshaken within.

### 2. Fulfillment in the New Testament

| Reference | Description | Parallel to Isaiah 50:7 |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Luke 9:51** | “When the days drew near for him to be taken up, **he set his face resolutely toward Jerusalem**.” | Almost a direct echo — Jesus shows firm determination despite knowing he will suffer. |
| **Mark 15:5** | Jesus **stands silent before Pilate**, though he faces injustice and death. | Shows composure, courage, and inner strength. |
| **John 18:4–8** | Jesus **steps forward voluntarily** to meet the soldiers arresting him. | Demonstrates willing surrender and fearless obedience. |

---

### 📊 3. Probability Estimate (realistic approximation)

| Feature | Prophecy (Isaiah 50:7) | Fulfillment (in Jesus) | Estimated Random Probability |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ Determined despite threat of death | “I set my face like flint.” | Jesus goes willingly to Jerusalem (Luke 9:51). | ~1 : 5 (most would try to escape) |
| 2️⃣ Trust in God’s help | “The Lord God helps me.” | Jesus prays in Gethsemane, trusting: “Your will be done.” | ~1 : 3 (faith common, but this level of resolve is rare) |
| 3️⃣ Not disgraced / ultimately vindicated | “I shall not be put to shame.” | Resurrection and moral victory after condemnation. | ~1 : 10 (rare moral triumph after execution) |

**Combined random probability (approx.):**

P(random) = 1/5 × 1/3 × 1/10 ≈ 1/150  

➡️ Roughly **1 in 150** chance that all three traits would align purely by coincidence.

# Isaiah 52 & 53: Precise prophecy concerning the crucifixion of Jesus Christ

Isaiah 52 and 53 contain incredible prophecies about the crucifixion and death of the Messiah. I can only recommend that everyone read these two chapters in the Bible. At this point, I will abbreviate somewhat and show the statements and their fulfillment in the New Testament, plus their probability, because there are simply too many precise prophecies about this event. 


| Reference | Prophecy (Isaiah) | Meaning / Description | Fulfillment in the New Testament | Estimated Random Probability |
|------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Isaiah 52:14** | “His appearance was disfigured more than any man.” | The Servant is brutally beaten and disfigured. | Jesus is scourged and beaten (Matthew 27:26–30). | ~1 : 20 (physical abuse common, but extreme disfigurement rare) |
| **Isaiah 53:3** | “He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows.” | The Messiah is rejected and suffers emotionally. | Jesus is rejected by the people (John 1:11; Luke 23:18–21). | ~1 : 10 (public rejection of a religious leader possible, but not inevitable) |
| **Isaiah 53:4–5** | “He was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities.” | His suffering is **substitutionary** — He bears others’ sins. | Central Christian belief: Jesus dies **for our sins** (1 Peter 2:24; Matthew 8:17). | ~1 : 100 (a theologically unique interpretation of death) |
| **Isaiah 53:7** | “He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth.” | The Servant suffers **silently and obediently**. | Jesus remains silent before Pilate (Mark 15:5; John 19:9). | ~1 : 20 (most defendants would protest their innocence) |
| **Isaiah 53:8** | “By oppression and judgment he was taken away… cut off from the land of the living.” | The Messiah dies **innocently through an unjust trial**. | Jesus is condemned though Pilate declares Him innocent (Luke 23:4–24). | ~1 : 50 (unjust execution possible, but detail is notable) |
| **Isaiah 53:9** | “They made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death.” | He dies among criminals but is buried in a **rich man’s tomb**. | Jesus dies between thieves, buried in **Joseph of Arimathea’s tomb** (Matthew 27:57–60). | ~1 : 500 (highly specific dual detail: dies with poor, buried with rich) |
| **Isaiah 53:10** | “Though his life is made an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days.” | His death is a **sacrifice**, yet he lives again — hint of **resurrection**. | Resurrection and life after death (Acts 2:24–32). | ~1 : 1,000 (predicting death + continued life is unique) |
| **Isaiah 53:12** | “He poured out his life unto death and was numbered with the transgressors.” | The Servant dies **among sinners** and **intercedes for them**. | Jesus is crucified between criminals, prays for his killers (Luke 23:32–34). | ~1 : 100 (rare combination of death type + intercession) |

---

### 📊 Overall Estimate (simplified combination)
If these eight details are treated as largely independent:

P(random) ≈ 1/20 × 1/10 × 1/100 × 1/20 × 1/50 × 1/500 × 1/1000 × 1/100  
≈ 1 / 10^18  

➡️ Roughly **1 in one quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000)** chance that all these details would align purely by coincidence.

---

**Summary:**  
Isaiah 52–53 presents an unusually dense sequence of predictions — rejection, suffering, silence, unjust death, burial with the rich, and ultimate vindication — all of which align strikingly with the New Testament account of Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection.

I have only taken prophecies from the Book of Isaiah here, and I did not do so by chance; I have a good reason for it. Such prophecies can also be found in other books of the Bible.

# Why?

The Prophecies of Isaiah and the Qumran Scrolls – Why They Cannot Have Been Written Later

One of the most fascinating aspects of the Bible is that the prophecies in the Book of Isaiah, especially chapters 52 and 53 about the suffering and death of the “Servant of God,” fit the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth in an astonishing way.
Critics long suspected that these texts might have been altered or supplemented later – that is, after Jesus' crucifixion in the 1st century AD.
However, archaeological finds from the Dead Sea have conclusively disproved this theory.

In 1947, a Bedouin boy discovered several clay jars containing ancient scrolls in a cave near Qumran, on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.
In the following years, over 900 scrolls and fragments were found in a total of eleven caves – including almost all the books of the Old Testament.
The most significant find is the so-called Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaᵃ) from Cave 1.
It contains the complete Book of Isaiah – from chapters 1 to 66 – and is fully preserved, 7.34 meters long and made of carefully inscribed parchment.

This Isaiah scroll has been dated to around 125 BC by radiocarbon dating (C14) and paleographic analysis of the script, with a possible margin of error of ±25 years.
This means that
the text existed at least 100 years before the birth of Jesus—that is, around 150–200 years before his crucifixion.
This rules out the possibility that the passages about the suffering servant of God (“He was pierced for our transgressions ...”, Isaiah 53:5) were written or adapted later in light of Jesus' crucifixion.

Particularly noteworthy:
A comparison of the Qumran Isaiah scroll with later Hebrew Bible manuscripts (e.g., the Codex Leningradensis from 1008 AD) shows an astonishingly high degree of textual fidelity.
Apart from minor orthographic differences (e.g., the spelling of individual words), the content of both versions is almost identical.
This shows that the Isaiah text has been handed down almost unchanged for more than a thousand years.

This provides clear historical evidence that

the Isaiah text in Qumran already contains the complete suffering prophecies (Isaiah 52:13–53:12).

These words were written down at least a century before Christ.

There is no archaeological or textual evidence to suggest that these chapters were added later.

In other words:
When Jesus was alive, the prophecies of Isaiah had long been available, and their correspondence with the events of the Passion cannot be attributed to subsequent adaptation.

The Qumran discoveries have thus revealed something unique:
The texts that Christians have read for centuries as messianic predictions are in fact pre-Christian documents.
They prove that the image of the “suffering servant of God” who is ‘pierced’ and “crushed for the sins of others” already existed in the original Hebrew text centuries before the crucifixion of Jesus.

# The destruction of Babylon was prophesied

Isaiah 13 contains one of the most impressive “prophecies of judgment” in the Old Testament: the announcement of the fall of Babylon—about 150 years before Babylon actually fell.

```
13 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
```

This marks the beginning of an entire section (Isaiah 13–14) that predicts the fall of the Babylonian Empire.

For context:

Isaiah was active in Judah from around 740 to 700 BC.

At that time, Assyria was the great power, while Babylon was still relatively insignificant.

It was not until about 100 years later (from 609 BC) that Babylon became a world power under Nebuchadnezzar II.

The fall of Babylon then took place in 539 BC, some 160–180 years after Isaiah's ministry.

Then it continues in verses 17-19: 

```
17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it. 18 Their bows will dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb. Their eyes will not spare children. 19 Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
```

Important details:

The enemy is named: the Medes (the Persians join later).

Babylon is completely destroyed and not rebuilt.

The image of Sodom and Gomorrah emphasizes: total devastation, no reconstruction.

Historical fulfillment

The prophecy was fulfilled in 539 BC when:

King Cyrus the Great, a Persian, conquered Babylon together with the Medes.

According to historical sources (Herodotus, Babylonian Chronicle), this happened almost without a fight after the Persians had diverted the Euphrates River.

After that, Babylon was politically disempowered and gradually lost its importance.

Later (after Alexander the Great), the city finally fell into ruin and was never permanently inhabited again—just as Isaiah 13:20–22 says:

```
20 It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from generation to generation. The Arabian will not pitch a tent there, neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there. 21 But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their houses will be full of jackals. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there. 22 Hyenas will cry in their fortresses, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.
```

### Why This Prophecy Is Historically Remarkable

| Aspect | Prophecy (Isaiah 13) | Fulfillment | Time Gap |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Rise of Babylon** | At the time of Isaiah, Babylon was **not yet a world power** — still under Assyrian dominance. | Babylon became an empire under **Nebuchadnezzar II (626–539 BC)**. | ~100 years after Isaiah. |
| **Invaders Named: the Medes** | “Behold, I will stir up the **Medes** against them…” (Isaiah 13:17). | **Medes and Persians** under Cyrus conquered Babylon in **539 BC**. | ~160 years after Isaiah. |
| **Permanent Destruction** | “Babylon… will be like **Sodom and Gomorrah**… it will never be inhabited again.” (Isaiah 13:19–20) | Babylon lost its power, became ruins, and has **never been permanently rebuilt**. | Fulfilled to this day. |

---

**Summary:**  
Isaiah 13 predicted the fall of Babylon **long before** the empire even rose to prominence.  
It named the **exact invaders (the Medes)** and foretold Babylon’s **permanent desolation** — all confirmed by later historical and archaeological evidence.  
The time gap of **about 150–180 years** between the prophecy and its fulfillment makes this one of the most striking long-range prophecies in ancient literature.

# How likely is this?

### 📊 Probability Estimate — Isaiah 13 (Prophecy of Babylon’s Fall)

| Predicted Event | Description (from Isaiah 13) | Historical Fulfillment | Estimated Random Probability |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **1️⃣ Babylon will fall violently** | Isaiah predicts the destruction of Babylon, even though it was not yet a major power in his day (~700 BC). | Babylon fell to the Medo-Persian army in 539 BC. | ~1 : 100 (predicting the fall of a small state that later becomes an empire is unlikely but not impossible). |
| **2️⃣ The invaders will be the Medes** | Isaiah explicitly names the *Medes* as Babylon’s future attackers (Isa 13:17). | The Medes (with the Persians under Cyrus) conquered Babylon. | ~1 : 1 000 (naming the correct nation 150+ years ahead is very specific). |
| **3️⃣ Babylon will be permanently desolate** | “It will never be inhabited again… only wild animals will dwell there.” (Isa 13:20–22) | The city was gradually abandoned and never rebuilt as a major city. | ~1 : 500 (cities often decline, but total, lasting desolation is rare). |
| **4️⃣ Comparison to Sodom and Gomorrah** | “It will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them.” (Isa 13:19) | Babylon’s ruins became symbolic of divine judgment and desolation. | ~1 : 100 (metaphorical but surprisingly accurate description). |

### Combined Probability (approximate, assuming partial independence)

P(random) = 1/100 × 1/1 000 × 1/500 × 1/100  
≈ **1 / 5 × 10⁹** (≈ 1 in 5 billion)

Roughly **one chance in five billion** that all these specific details could align purely by coincidence.

---

### Interpretation
- **Isaiah wrote ~150–180 years before** Babylon’s fall, when **Assyria** was still the dominant empire.  
- He **named the exact future invaders (Medes)** and described **permanent ruin**, which history confirms.  
- While any single prediction might be luck, the **combination of timing, naming, and lasting desolation** makes a random fulfillment **extremely improbable**.

# Daniel prophesies the succession of world empires

Daniel's historical situation

Daniel was a young man when he was taken from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar around 605 BC.

There (and later under the Persians), he served as an advisor and dream interpreter at the royal court.

The Book of Daniel describes visions spanning approximately 70 years.

However, the text itself speaks of events that lie centuries in the future.

### 🪞 2. The Vision of the Four World Empires (Daniel 2)

In Daniel 2, King **Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon** dreams of a huge **statue made of four metals** — gold, silver, bronze, and iron (with clay mixed in the feet).  
Daniel interprets the dream as a prophecy about **four successive world empires** that will rise and fall, followed by a fifth kingdom established by God.

| Part of the Statue | Material | Symbolic Empire | Historical Fulfillment |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Head** | **Gold** | **Babylonian Empire** (Nebuchadnezzar) | 605 – 539 BC |
| **Chest and Arms** | **Silver** | **Medo-Persian Empire** | 539 – 331 BC |
| **Belly and Thighs** | **Bronze** | **Greek Empire** (Alexander the Great) | 331 – 146 BC |
| **Legs** | **Iron** | **Roman Empire** | from 146 BC onward |
| **Feet and Toes** | **Iron mixed with clay** | **Divided or fragmented kingdoms** (later stages of Rome) | after ~400 AD |

At the end of the vision, a **“stone cut out without human hands”** strikes the statue and destroys it.  
This stone represents the **Kingdom of God**, which, according to Daniel 2:44,  
> “will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people; it will crush all these kingdoms and will itself endure forever.”

### 3. Daniel’s Second Vision (Daniel 7)

In Daniel 7, the prophet receives a **vision of four great beasts** rising from the sea.  
These beasts symbolize the **same sequence of world empires** as the statue in Daniel 2, but with more emphasis on their nature and character.

| Beast | Description | Symbolic Empire | Key Characteristics |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **1️⃣ Lion with eagle’s wings** | Majestic, powerful, later its wings are plucked. | **Babylonian Empire** | Strength, pride, and later humiliation (Nebuchadnezzar’s fall). |
| **2️⃣ Bear raised up on one side, with three ribs in its mouth** | Uneven power, devours much flesh. | **Medo-Persian Empire** | Two unequal parts (Medes & Persians), expansion by conquest. |
| **3️⃣ Leopard with four wings and four heads** | Very swift and divided into four. | **Greek Empire** | Alexander’s rapid conquests and the later division into four kingdoms. |
| **4️⃣ Terrifying beast with iron teeth and ten horns** | Different from all before it, devours and crushes everything. | **Roman Empire** | Military strength, domination, and later fragmentation (ten horns = later kingdoms). |

After the beasts, Daniel sees a **heavenly court** where the “Ancient of Days” sits in judgment  
and the **“Son of Man”** receives eternal dominion (Daniel 7:13–14):

> “And to him was given authority, glory and sovereign power;  
> all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him.  
> His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away.”

This vision parallels the statue in Daniel 2 but adds a **spiritual conclusion** —  
the rise of the **eternal Kingdom of God**, ruled by the “Son of Man.”

### 4. Historical Fulfillment of Daniel’s Prophecies

The sequence of empires predicted in Daniel 2 and 7 can be traced precisely through recorded world history.  
Each kingdom matches the symbolic imagery and the order Daniel described — centuries before most of these events occurred.

| Prophetic Stage | Historical Fulfillment | Time Period | Notable Details |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Babylonian Empire** | Founded by **Nebuchadnezzar II**; conquered Judah and destroyed the Temple in 586 BC. | 605 – 539 BC | Represented by the **gold head** and **lion with eagle’s wings**. |
| **Medo-Persian Empire** | Established by **Cyrus the Great** after conquering Babylon. | 539 – 331 BC | Two-part power structure (Medes + Persians) matches the **silver chest and arms** / **bear with two sides**. |
| **Greek Empire** | Created by **Alexander the Great**, who rapidly conquered the known world. | 331 – 146 BC | Symbolized by **bronze belly and thighs** / **leopard with four wings** (Alexander’s four successors). |
| **Roman Empire** | Expanded across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. | 146 BC – 476 AD | Depicted as **iron legs** / **terrifying beast** — strong, relentless, crushing its enemies. |
| **Divided Kingdoms** | After Rome’s fall, Europe splits into many smaller nations. | from ~400 AD onward | Symbolized by **feet and toes of iron mixed with clay** — partly strong, partly brittle. |

At the end of this sequence, Daniel foretells the appearance of a **divine kingdom** that will replace all human empires:

> “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.”  
> — *Daniel 2:44*

This long-range prophecy accurately outlines over **600 years of geopolitical history**,  
from Babylon’s rise to Rome’s decline — a sequence unmatched in ancient literature.

### 5. Archaeological and Textual Evidence

Modern archaeology and manuscript studies provide strong evidence that the Book of Daniel — and its world-empire prophecies — existed **long before** many of the predicted events took place.

#### The Dead Sea Scrolls (Qumran)
- Fragments of **the Book of Daniel** were found among the **Dead Sea Scrolls** at Qumran.  
- These include copies of **Daniel chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12**.  
- The manuscripts are dated by **paleography and carbon-14** to around **150–125 BC**.  
- This means that the Book of Daniel was already **in circulation** at least **150 years before the birth of Christ** — and before the rise of the **Roman Empire**, which Daniel’s visions already describe.

#### Textual Stability
- The Qumran fragments match the later **Masoretic Hebrew Text** with remarkable accuracy.  
- Apart from minor spelling differences, **the content is identical** — proving that the text was **not rewritten or “updated”** after the predicted events occurred.

#### Historical References
- Ancient Jewish and Greek sources (e.g., **Josephus**, *Antiquities* 10.11.7) mention Daniel as a respected prophet known **before the Maccabean era**.  
- The **Septuagint (Greek Old Testament)**, translated around **250–200 BC**, already includes the Book of Daniel — further confirming its pre-Christian origin.

---

### Summary

The **archaeological record** leaves no credible room for the claim that Daniel’s prophecies were written *after* the events they describe.  
The **Qumran manuscripts** and early translations demonstrate that Daniel’s visions of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome were already well-known **centuries before** their fulfillment.

In other words:  
> The Book of Daniel is not a product of hindsight — it is a document of foresight,  
> preserved with extraordinary textual precision for over two millennia.

### 6. Probability Estimate — Daniel’s Prophecies of the World Empires

Daniel’s visions (chapters 2 and 7) describe the rise and fall of four successive world empires, their internal features, and their eventual division — all centuries before these events unfolded.  
Below is a simplified statistical approximation of how unlikely it would be for these details to align purely by coincidence.

| Event | Prophetic Detail | Historical Fulfillment | Estimated Random Probability |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **1️⃣ Correct order of four major empires** | Babylon → Medo-Persia → Greece → Rome | Matches world history precisely. | ~1 : 10 000 (predicting four global powers in order is extremely unlikely). |
| **2️⃣ Dual nature of the second empire** | The “chest and arms of silver” / “bear raised on one side” symbolize two unequal powers. | Medes + Persians form a combined but asymmetric empire. | ~1 : 1 000 |
| **3️⃣ Division of the Greek Empire into four parts** | “Leopard with four heads and wings.” | After Alexander’s death, his empire split into four kingdoms. | ~1 : 500 |
| **4️⃣ Fourth empire stronger than iron, later fragmented** | “Legs of iron… feet of iron mixed with clay.” | Rome’s unmatched strength, later division into eastern and western realms and smaller kingdoms. | ~1 : 500 |
| **5️⃣ The rise of a divine, everlasting kingdom** | “A stone cut without hands destroys the statue.” | The spread of the Gospel and enduring Christian faith (interpreted theologically). | Not statistically quantifiable, symbolic domain. |

# The prophecy of the return of the Israelites

### Combined Probability (approximation)

If the first four historical details are treated as roughly independent:

P(random) ≈ 1/10 000 × 1/1 000 × 1/500 × 1/500  
≈ **1 / 2.5 × 10¹³**

➡️ Roughly **one chance in 25 trillion** that this sequence and its characteristics would match history purely by coincidence.

---

### 💡 Interpretation

- Daniel’s visions outline over **six centuries of imperial history** with correct order and unique identifying features.  
- Even under conservative assumptions, the probability of this alignment arising accidentally is **astronomically small**.  
- Combined with archaeological evidence (Dead Sea Scrolls, early Greek translations), the data strongly supports that Daniel’s prophecies were **written long before** the empires they describe.

> **In short:**  
> Daniel’s description of the four empires is not a lucky guess — it is one of the most striking long-range prophetic sequences in ancient literature.

## 🇮🇱 The Return of the Jewish People to the Land of Israel — Biblical Prophecy and Historical Fulfillment

The return of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland is one of the **central and most remarkable prophecies** of the Bible.  
It appears in **two distinct phases**:  
1️⃣ the **first return** from the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BC,  
2️⃣ and a **future, worldwide regathering** that many believe corresponds to the **modern rebirth of Israel in 1948**.

---

### 1. First Fulfillment — Return from the Babylonian Exile (6th Century BC)

After Jerusalem was destroyed in 586 BC, the Jews lived in Babylonian captivity for 70 years.  
Several prophets — **Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel** — foretold not only the exile but also the **return** to their land.

| Prophet | Reference | Prophecy | Fulfillment |
|----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Isaiah** | Isaiah 44:28 – 45:1 | God names **Cyrus** as the king who will let Israel return and rebuild Jerusalem. | **Cyrus the Great** issued the decree in **538 BC** allowing Jews to return. |
| **Jeremiah** | Jeremiah 29:10 | “After seventy years are completed at Babylon, I will bring you back.” | The exile lasted about **70 years** (606–536 BC). |
| **Daniel** | Daniel 9:2 | Daniel reads Jeremiah and prays for restoration. | Daniel witnesses Cyrus’ decree. |
| **Ezra 1:1–3** | — | Cyrus officially permits the Jews to rebuild the Temple. | Confirmed by the **Cyrus Cylinder** (British Museum). |

➡️ These predictions were **fulfilled literally and historically** in the 6th century BC.

---

### 2. Second Fulfillment — Worldwide Regathering of Israel

Many later prophecies speak of a **second return**, not just from Babylon but from **all nations of the earth** — a global restoration.  
This points beyond the ancient exile and aligns closely with the **modern return of Jews to Israel (1948–present)**.

| Prophet | Reference | Key Message |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Isaiah 11:11–12** | “The Lord will set His hand **a second time** to recover the remnant of His people from the four corners of the earth.” |
| **Jeremiah 31:8–10** | “I will bring them from the north country and gather them from the ends of the earth.” |
| **Ezekiel 36:24** | “I will take you from among the nations and bring you into your own land.” |
| **Ezekiel 37:21–22** | “I will gather them from every side and make them one nation in their own land.” |
| **Amos 9:14–15** | “I will plant them in their land, and they shall **never again be uprooted** from it.” |

➡️ These verses explicitly describe a **worldwide regathering**, a **second restoration**, and **permanent resettlement** — all details that go far beyond the Babylonian return.

---

### 3. Historical Development — Modern Fulfillment

| Year | Historical Event | Connection to Prophecy |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **70 AD** | Jerusalem destroyed by Rome; Jews dispersed among the nations. | Predicted dispersion: *Deuteronomy 28:64*. |
| **1897** | First Zionist Congress (Theodor Herzl, Basel). | Beginning of the modern “return movement.” |
| **1917** | Balfour Declaration: British support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. | Step toward restoration. |
| **1948** | **State of Israel declared** on May 14. | Echoes Isaiah 11:11 and Ezekiel 37:21. |
| **1990s–today** | Massive immigration from Russia, Ethiopia, USA, Europe. | “I will gather you from all nations” (Ezekiel 36:24). |

---

### 4. Probability Estimate

| Event | Prophetic Statement | Estimated Random Probability |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Return after 70 years from Babylon | Jeremiah 29:10 | ~1 : 100 |
| Return under a king **named Cyrus** | Isaiah 44:28 – 45:1 | ~1 : 1,000 (name given 150 years in advance) |
| Worldwide regathering of Israel in the last days | Isaiah 11:11; Ezekiel 36:24 | ~1 : 1,000 |
| Permanent settlement — “never again uprooted” | Amos 9:15 | so far accurate (~1 : 500) |

**Combined probability (approximation):**

P(random) = 1/100 × 1/1,000 × 1/1,000 × 1/500 ≈ **1 / 50,000,000,000**

➡️ Roughly **1 in 50 billion** chance that all these prophecies would align by coincidence.

---

### 5. Summary

The **return of the Jewish people** is one of the **most clearly fulfilled prophecies in history**:

1. **Historically** — The return from Babylon (6th century BC) fulfilled Jeremiah and Isaiah exactly.  
2. **Globally** — The modern restoration (1948–present) mirrors prophecies of a second, worldwide return.  

The **Dead Sea Scrolls** confirm that these prophetic texts (Isaiah, Ezekiel, Amos) existed **centuries before Christ**, ruling out any post-event editing.  
Thus, the restoration of Israel stands as one of the **most verifiable and ongoing prophetic fulfillments** in world history — visible to this very day.

## ⚓ Prophecy Against Tyre — Ezekiel 26–28

### 📖 1. The Prophecy (Ezekiel 26:1–14)

In the 6th century BC, the prophet **Ezekiel** delivered a detailed prophecy about the destruction of **Tyre (Tyrus)**, a powerful Phoenician port city on the Mediterranean coast.

> **Ezekiel 26:3–5, 12, 14**  
> “I am against you, O Tyre…  
> Many nations will come up against you…  
> They will destroy your walls and break down your towers;  
> I will scrape her dust from her and make her a **bare rock**.  
> She shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea.  
> …They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise;  
> They will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses.  
> …You shall **never be rebuilt**, for I the Lord have spoken.”

---

### 🏛️ 2. Key Details of the Prophecy

| Detail | Description | Predicted in Ezekiel | Historical Fulfillment |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **1️⃣ Many nations will attack Tyre** | Tyre will face multiple successive invasions. | 26:3 | Fulfilled over centuries — by **Babylon**, **Persia**, **Greece**, and later **Rome**. |
| **2️⃣ Nebuchadnezzar will besiege Tyre** | The first major attacker is identified by name. | 26:7–11 | **Nebuchadnezzar II** besieged Tyre for **13 years (586–573 BC)**. |
| **3️⃣ City will be scraped “like a bare rock”** | The ruins and debris will be thrown into the sea. | 26:4, 12 | **Alexander the Great (332 BC)** used Tyre’s rubble to build a **causeway** to the island fortress, literally pushing debris into the sea. |
| **4️⃣ Fishermen will spread their nets there** | The site will become a flat, abandoned place by the sea. | 26:5, 14 | Today the ancient mainland site is used by **local fishermen** — exactly as described. |
| **5️⃣ Tyre will never be rebuilt to former glory** | Complete and permanent downfall. | 26:14 | The ancient mainland Tyre remains in ruins; the island city declined and never regained its power. |

---

### 🧭 3. Historical Overview

| Year | Event | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **586–573 BC** | Siege by Nebuchadnezzar II (Babylon). | Destroyed the mainland city; survivors fled to an island offshore. |
| **332 BC** | Conquest by Alexander the Great (Greece). | Built a causeway from debris, captured and destroyed the island city. |
| **After 300 BC** | Decline under Hellenistic & Roman rule. | Tyre lost independence and became a small coastal town. |
| **Today** | Modern town of Ṣūr (Lebanon) near ruins. | The ancient site remains a **“bare rock”**, partly submerged. |

---

### 📊 4. Probability Estimate

| Prophetic Detail | Specificity | Estimated Random Probability |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Many nations invade over time | Moderate (unusual for one city) | ~1 : 50 |
| Named attacker: Nebuchadnezzar | High (specific name, before event) | ~1 : 1 000 |
| City debris thrown into the sea | Extremely specific | ~1 : 1 000 |
| Site becomes a flat “bare rock” used by fishermen | Highly unusual outcome | ~1 : 500 |
| City never fully rebuilt | Historically accurate, rare | ~1 : 500 |

**Combined probability (approximation):**

P(random) = 1/50 × 1/1 000 × 1/1 000 × 1/500 × 1/500  
≈ **1 / 1.25 × 10¹⁴**

➡️ Roughly **1 in 125 trillion** chance that all details would coincide purely by accident.

---

### 💡 5. Summary

The prophecy against Tyre (Ezekiel 26–28) stands out for its **specificity and layered fulfillment**:

- **Nebuchadnezzar** destroyed the mainland city (first phase).  
- **Alexander the Great** threw its debris into the sea (second phase).  
- The **site remains barren** and used by fishermen, exactly as described.  

Archaeology and history confirm that these events unfolded **exactly as Ezekiel recorded**, over a span of **250 years** —  
making this one of the **clearest, multi-stage fulfilled prophecies** in the entire Bible.
