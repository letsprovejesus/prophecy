# Introduction

There are over 3,000 prophecies in the Bible that have come true. However, many atheists claim that these prophecies do not exist or are too vague. Some may be vague, but there are enough that are not. I will present these prophecies here, along with their probability.

# The birth of Jesus in Bethlehem

It was prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. The following passage from the Old Testament prophesies this: 

Micah 5:2 says the following: (WEB)
```
‚ÄúBut you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
    though you are small among the clans[b] of Judah,
out of you will come for me
    one who will be ruler over Israel,
whose origins are from of old,
    from ancient times.‚Äù
```

At this point, it is prophesied that the future Messiah will be born in Bethlehem. 

This is confirmed in the New Testament in the following passages:
Matthew 2, 1,6
```
2 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men[a] from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, 2 ‚ÄúWhere is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.‚Äù 3 When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. 4 Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. 5 They said to him, ‚ÄúIn Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet,

6 ‚ÄòYou Bethlehem, land of Judah,
    are in no way least among the princes of Judah;
for out of you shall come a governor
    who shall shepherd my people, Israel.‚Äô‚Äù
```

This is also confirmed in Luke 2:1-7:

```
2 Now in those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. 2 This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city. 4 Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David‚Äôs city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, 5 to enroll himself with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him as wife, being pregnant.

6 While they were there, the day had come for her to give birth. 7 She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.
```

# How likely was it that he would be born in Bethlehem of all places? 

At that time, Bethlehem was a small, insignificant village‚Äînot Jerusalem, not Hebron, not Samaria.
This makes the prophecy concrete and verifiable.


How small was Bethlehem at the time of Jesus?

Archaeological estimates:

Population of Bethlehem at the time of Jesus: approx. 300‚Äì1,000 people

Total population of Judea (including Galilee and Samaria): approx. 500,000‚Äì1,000,000 people

If you were born in Judea by chance, the probability that it would be in Bethlehem would be approximately:

### üìò Given Assumptions
| Variable | Meaning | Estimated Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| \( N_{\text{total}} \) | Total population of Judea (including Galilee & Samaria, around 1st century) | \( 1{,}000{,}000 \) people |
| \( N_{\text{Bethlehem}} \) | Population of Bethlehem at the time of Jesus | \( 1{,}000 \) people |

### üìò Given Assumptions
| Variable | Meaning | Estimated Value |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| \( N_{\text{total}} \) | Total population of Judea | \( 1{,}000{,}000 \) |
| \( N_{\text{Bethlehem}} \) | Population of Bethlehem | \( 1{,}000 \) |

\[
P(\text{Bethlehem}) = \frac{N_{\text{Bethlehem}}}{N_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1{,}000}{1{,}000{,}000} = 0{.}001 = 0{.}1\%
\]
